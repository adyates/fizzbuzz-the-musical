The HTML/CSS version
====================

Special Rules for development

  * Because this is the web, this should make visual sense for the web, with only CSS.
  * Since displaying 100 FizzBuzz numbers at one time is silly, Javascript can be used only to add
    divs and hide the old ones as part of keeping values above the fold.  All divs must end up in the same steady state.
  * External CSS libraries and build tools such as CSS pre-compilers are allowed.
  * Evolutions must introduce at least one design element or CSS3 concept.  Features of pre-compilers do not count.
